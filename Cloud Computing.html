    <h1>Cloud computing defined </h1>
   <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
     You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.</p>
    <p>Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing resources, like storage, servers, and software, over the internet. It allows users to access and store information without having to manage their own physical devices or IT infrastructure.</p>
