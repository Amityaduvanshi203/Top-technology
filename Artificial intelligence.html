    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. 
        It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence 
        to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.
        [1] Such machines may be called AIs.</p>

        <p>High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."[2][3]</p>
